The purpose of this project is to explore data frame manipulations with the pandas 
package. Inital test tried to use the faker package to create network data. After 
discovery it would take more work to create fake data for a desired effect, I switch
to using the inflation calculator from API Ninjas.

This should output a scatter plot that shows the difference of monthly vs yearly 
inflation rate of 38 major countries. The histograms show the distribution across
the time periods more clearly.
